Derick Dinh, Graphic Designer

I take everything in life as an adventure, that way when I'm older I can tell all of my stories, because how boring is an individual without any stories to tell? I like to think the same way when it comes to design, every design should tell a story, because at the end of the day a story is what captivates people.
