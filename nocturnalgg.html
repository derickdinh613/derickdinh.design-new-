      <p class="wrapper max-length">NocturnalGG is a North-American Premier E-sports and content creation team (created by yours truly) with teams competing in games like Call of Duty and Counter Strike along with streamers representing the organization from all regions of the world. The name represented an average gamers life. Staying up all night to play the game, and what better animal to represent the organization than the owl itself, wide eyed in the night.</p>

          <p>As time went on it was realized that Nocturnal’s logo didn’t feel like a logo that aligned with an E-sports brand, shortly after the second iteration of the Nocturnal logo was created.</p>

          <p>Nocturnal’s official Jersey design along with the #allnighters tee. Most E-sports jerseys don't have a theme within their jerseys and feature just lines and shapes. With Nocturnal's jersey it sets out to follow the theme of the owl, the yellow on the jersey portraying a feather.</p>
